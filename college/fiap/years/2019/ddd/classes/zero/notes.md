## How computer process programming commands
### Machine language
- The capacity of executing commands is equals to CPU bit numbers
  - 32bits/64bits = 2 ** n where n=number of bits
- Hertz represents the number of operations that can be executed
  - 3GHz = 3 mi commands per second
### Low level programming language (Assembly)
- Instructions are wrapped by language specific builtin commands
  - MOV, STR, GET
### Hight level programming language (Java)
- Almost all command management is transparent to developer
  - human readable commands

## Java principles
### Conventions
- naming convention
  - class name with camelcase
  - identation
  - line breaking inside code blocks
### Hands on coding
- declare public class
- add main method
- explain camelcases
- print with ``System.out.println``
- import module
- print with ``JOptionPane``
