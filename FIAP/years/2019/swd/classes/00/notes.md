# Software Design - Allen
## Subject and instructor presentation
- **Software development first steps**
  - Project initialization
    - target public *(stakeholder)*
      - where you go to get information and apply your assessment on?
    - attributes: time, cost, scope and risk
      - changing one's size impact directly on the another attributes
    - business layer
      - will understand the contractor needs and the key objective
    - product layer
      - will understand the public that the contractor wants to impact, following business constraints
    - cronogram
  - Requirements assessment
    - user requirements
  - System modeling (UML)
    - prototypes
    - mockups

Some obsevations:
- always consider geographical and national constraints over project constraints
- each layer have your respective stakeholder, it isn't always the same for everyone
  - eg.: bussiness stakeholder = contractor, product stakeholder = final consumer
